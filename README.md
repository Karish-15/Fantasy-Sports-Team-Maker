# Fantasy Sports Team Maker

## Structure:

-**functions.py**: Contains functions used to form teams from given data

-**prepare_json.py**: Uses `json` module to prepare a JSON which is used to store a dictionary containing player data. JSONs were used because I plan to automate the process of retrieving player data and converting into JSON.

-**main.py**: makes use of functions to return us a list that contains all formed teams. The teams are also sorted in descending order.

---

Currently the teams are sorted according to sum of performance points. I'm still working on something to sort the teams in a much more appropriate manner.

I'm working to add many more features to this project, will update this repo soon :D
